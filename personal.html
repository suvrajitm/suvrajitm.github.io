<h2>More About Me</h2>
<div align="justify">Science and research consumes most of my time. However, I have various interests and hobbies beyond academics, even though, I am not able to pursue all of them at the same time.<br> 
<br> <b>Art and Painting</b> <br>I developed interest in drawing since I was a little kid. I loved to draw potraits of famous person and mythical Indian Gods. 
I never enrolled in a professional Art school, however took lessons from a private teacher for about 4 years. I took the Fine Arts(Painting) 
examination of an Art Academy called <a href="http://www.pracheenkalakendra.org/?page_id=4158" style="text-decoration: none">Pracheen Kala Kendra</a>,
Chandigarh, India. I could only complete upto 4th year ("Chitra Bhushan" Part I, II, III and "Chitra Visharad" part I). I regret that I could not 
finish one more year of painting, "Chitra Visharad" part II to obtain the diploma "Chitra Visharad". I couldn't continue any further as I was entering 
10th grade and my teacher left for his higher diploma in painting and I got busy with high school and then undergraduate studies. I have used various mediums 
such as pencils, crayons, pastels, water color. I still wish that someday I can start learning "Oil Painting" ! I started paiting again on and off since  
December 2012 (check out my gallery page if intereseted), but after moving to New York City in 2015, I had to pause due to the hectic life and housing situation. 
I hope to start again!<br>
<br> <b>Sports</b> <br> I am also a big sports lover. I love to watch and play many games and always keen to learn new ones if possible. I come from a nation where the most popular game is <a href="http://www.cricinfo.com/" style="text-decoration: none">cricket</a>. I used to play and enjoy watching the game whenever I could, but lately, I have not been following the game much. Also, I come from a football (soccer) loving region(eastern part of india), which is actually my favorite game to play. I also like swimming, badminton, table tennis, volleyball, basketball and tennis which I really enjoy playing now. <br>
<br> <b>Music</b> <br>I always loved listening to music of all kinds, but never really got into learning. Although my two sisters took Indian classical music lessons for some years, I was simply content with my studies, sports and paintings ! Not sure why, but I never felt stongly about learning music or, any instrument when I was growing up. Even in college, I did not take up any extra-curricular activities. After I started my graduate school, I realized that something was missing. I started with Guitar(self-teaching) in my first half of grad school and then picked up flute. I just learn and practice guitar and flute once in a while when I have time. It's a very slow progress. Currently, I have started learning Violin since summer of 2017. I am self teaching myself through youtube lessons.<br>
<br> <b>Universe and the World</b> <br>Last, but not the least, I'm always keen to learn about variety of topics, be it scientific, philoshopical and spiritual, metaphysical or anything else. Yes, knowledge is power ! I love to read anything and everything I find about the universe, the nature, the earth and its civilization throughout the human history. I'm intereseted in knowing new planets or stars found in the galaxy, new scientific discovery, or a new theory, new archaeological discoveries about early civilization, their culture, religion, etc. I really can't have enough of these things.<br>
